    <h2>The History of 2130 Robotics</h2>
    <p><b>Team Alpha+ 2130</b> was founded in 2007. Since then, we have built a unique robot every year. Each robot was
      designed with a different task in mind. Every year, the competition
      is completely different, so there is no hope of reusing one from a previous year.</p>

        <h2>2018 - Libra</h2>
        <p>The game for 2018, FIRST POWER UP! involved scoring points on an arcade-themed field. Teams were challenged to place milk crates, or "power cubes" on balancing platforms,
         attempting to tip them to their side to gain ownership. Alliances also traded power cubes for “power ups,” giving them a temporary advantage in the game. At the end 
         of the game, robots attempted to climb the tower attached to the center balancing scale, giving them additional points. We attended the Idaho Regional at the Taco 
         Bell Arena in Boise, from March 28-April 1, and the Canadian Rockies Regional at the Genesis Centre in Calgary, AB from April 4-8. In all, we competed with over 70 teams
         from Wyoming, California, Utah, Washington, Colorado, Montana, Hawaii, Idaho, Canada, Mexico, Germany, Turkey, and China. In Boise, we ranked 8th and were the first 
         pick by Alliance 3, 3239 Birds of Prey and 3288 Punchers. We finished as Regional Finalist and received a Wildcard to qualify for Worlds. In Calgary, we ranked 5th and 
         were the first pick by Alliance 2, 3250 Kennedy Robotics and 5630 The Nomads. We finished as Regional Finalist and received a Wildcard to qualify for Worlds. 
         In Calgary, we also received the Innovation in Control Award sponsored by Rockwell Automation. This award “celebrates an innovative control system or 
         application of control components – electrical, mechanical, or software – to provide unique machine functions.” At the World Championship in Houston, Texas, 
         were in the Turing Division. We ranked 30th, and were chosen by #1 Alliance as 4th alternative partner with 120 Cleveland’s Best (we replaced them after first 
         final match), 2471 Team Mean Machine (PNW!) and 2557 SOTAbots (PNW!!) We played in after the first game, replacing Team 120, Cleveland’s Best. We made it to 
         quarterfinals! Alpha+ also competed with 23 other teams at the off-season event, Robot Rewind, at West Valley High School in Spokane, WA. Joining us were members of 
         our middle school robotics class who helped with scouting. We played FIRST POWER UP! and ranked 13th at the end of the qualifying matches. We were chosen by the 
         third-ranked team, 4513 Circuit Breakers and played with teams 4061 SciBorgs and 6465 Mystic Biscuit. We made it to the semi-finals, finishing in fourth place!</p>

        <h2>2017 - Nameless</h2>
        <p>The game for 2017 was FIRST Steamworks. The game highlighted an era in which technology relied on steam power to fly its airships. Each three-team alliance scored 
          points by collecting fuel (whiffle balls) to build steam pressure, installing gears to engage motors and boarding robots onto their airships. At the end of each 
          match, the alliance with the highest score earned the win. We attended the Western Canada Regional in Calgary, Alberta where we competed with teams from Turkey, 
          Poland, China, Australia, Mexico, Canada, and the United States. Team member, Rayan Naylor, accompanied by four Michigan team members, sang the Star Spangled Banner. 
          The drive team worked its calm, focused magic, and with our exceptionally performing robot, advanced our standing to 10th place at the end of qualification matches. 
          Our robot’s reliable gear collector, consistent speed across the field, and elegant climber contributed greatly to each match. During the playoffs alliance selection, 
          Alpha+ was chosen by the second-ranked team, 4627 Manning Robotics. Along with Team 5630 Canada Crew, the alliance performed well, making it to the semi-finals. For 
          the second time, Alpha+ received the Entrepreneurship Award which “recognizes a team’s entrepreneurial enthusiasm and the vital business skills to ensure a 
          self-sustaining program.”<br><br>
          Alpha+ also competed with 22 other teams at the off-season event, Robot Rewind, at West Valley High School in Spokane, WA. Joining us were members of our middle 
          school robotics class who worked on scouting and entered data into our computer spreadsheet. We played last season's game, FIRST Steamworks, and were allowed to 
          enter a second robot. Many of our new team members designed and built that robot (2) and became part of the drive team. At the end of the qualifying matches, 
          Alpha+ was ranked #1! We picked our beta robot, 2, and 8147 (Team Chuck's beta robot) to be our alliance partners. At the end of the finals, Alpha+ finished 
          in second place!</p>
